<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Jovanni Sanchez </h1>

<p>
<b>Hi</b>, welcome to my profile. I'm currently a high school junior and learning C++.
I made this account for my computer science course, but I decide I would personalize it a little.
I like coding, learning, and video games, but I especially <b>love</b> customization.
One day, I want to make my own website to sort of blog stuff down like I'm doing on this, maybe even make a portfolio. 
I'm not sure how I am going to do it, but I'm looking into <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>.

    <ul>
<li> Checkout my playlists and what music I listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31hnk265gaue64zclw326f2gdjfa">here</a>. Alternatively, you can view what I'm currently listening to on the right side of this table.
<li> If you use desktop <a href="https://download.scdn.co/SpotifySetup.exe">Spotify</a>, I highly recommend <a href="https://spicetify.app/">Spicetify</a>. It will allow you to have a highly customizable and ad-free <b>(Shh...)</b> Spotify experience. My personal recommendation for themes are: <a href="https://github.com/JulienMaille/spicetify-dynamic-theme">DynamicDefault</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Comfy-Themes/Spicetify">Comfy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/spicetify">Catppuccin</a>.
<li> I'm turning 16 on the 29th of September <b>(yay!!!)</b>, meaning that I could get my learner permit (thanks NY). A learner permit would let me work up towards a driver lisence. I really want to be able to have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31hnk265gaue64zclw326f2gdjfa">Kawasaki Ninja 400</a> or a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31hnk265gaue64zclw326f2gdjfa">KTM Duke 390</a>, but they are a lot of money. <b>( even the used ones are a lot :c )</b>
      </ul>
